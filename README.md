**_About Class Diagram_**
- The classes that are wrapped in dark rectangle in above figure are entity classes and the entity classes map to tables in the database.
- The entities have common fields which are grouped in _AbstractEntity_ class to avoid having duplicated code.
    - These entities are used by hibernate to identify uniquely each entity instance (_id_) and fields used to audit each entity instance (_createdAt and modifiedAt_) and keep track of how many times an entity was modified (_version_)
